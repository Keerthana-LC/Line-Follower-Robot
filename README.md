Arduino-based Line Follower Robot using IR sensors and motor driver.
# Line Follower Robot üöó

This is an Arduino-based Line Follower Robot project. The robot uses IR sensors to detect a line on the surface and moves accordingly using the L298N motor driver module.  

## üîß Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- IR Sensor  
- 2WD Car Kit  
- L298N Motor Driver Module  
- 7‚Äì12 V DC Battery (LiPo 2S in our case)  
- Jumper Wires  
- Glue Gun  
- Double Sided Tape  
- Black Electrical Tape  

## ‚ö° Project Description
A Line Follower Robot is an **autonomous mobile robot** designed to follow a predetermined path, usually a black line on a contrasting surface.  

These robots are widely used in:  
- Industrial automation  
- Warehouse management  
- Robotics competitions  

The line follower robot operates based on **infrared (IR) sensor technology**.  
- The IR sensors detect the contrast between the black line (track) and the white background.  
- Arduino processes the input from sensors.  
- The L298N motor driver controls the motors accordingly, making the robot follow the track.
